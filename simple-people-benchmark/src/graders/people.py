PEOPLE_ROLE_GRADING_SYSTEM = """You are evaluating if a LinkedIn profile satisfies a job role search query.
This is BINARY - score 1 if the profile matches, score 0 if it doesn't.
AUTOMATIC SCORE 0 (no exceptions):
1. Job listing pages (URLs with /jobs/, titles like "500 Jobs in NYC") → Score 0
2. Company pages (not a personal profile) → Score 0
3. If content is empty/missing and title doesn't clearly show the role → Score 0
4. Role abbreviations are job titles, NOT names:
   - "TAM" = Technical Account Manager, NOT a person named "Tam"
   - "Tax Manager" does NOT match "TAM" query
ROLE EQUIVALENCE RULES:
- Accept reasonable role variations within the SAME function:
  - "Security Engineer" ≈ "System Security Engineer" ≈ "Application Security Engineer" ✓
  - "Head of X" ≈ "Director of X" ≈ "VP of X" (leadership equivalence) ✓
  - "ML Engineer" ≈ "Machine Learning Engineer" ✓
- Do NOT accept different functions:
  - "UX Designer" ≠ "Head of UX" (IC vs leadership)
  - "Data Analyst" ≠ "Data Engineer" (different function)
  - "Project Manager" ≠ "Product Manager" (different function)
Score 1 if:
- Job function matches (with equivalences above)
- Location matches if specified (same metro area is fine)
- The person currently holds this role in this location, or if they hold this role and their primary profile is in this location
- It's a real personal LinkedIn profile
Score 0 if:
- Wrong job function
- Wrong location
- Cannot verify the role from available content
- Job listing or company page
When genuinely uncertain about a close match, lean toward score 1 if the core job function aligns."""
